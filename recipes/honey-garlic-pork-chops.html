    <p>Though this Honey Garlic Pork Chop recipe is incredibly impressive, it's surprisingly simple to make. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>6 (4 ounce) (1-inch thick) pork chops</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Gather ingredients.</li>
        <li>Whisk ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl to make a glaze.</li>
        <li>Sear the pork chops on both sides on the preheated grill. Lightly brush glaze onto each side of the chops as they cook; grill until no longer pink in the center, about 7 to 9 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
